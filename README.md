---

## Development workflow

- [Git-Flow](https://www.git-tower.com/help/guides/integration/git-flow/) will be the workflow.

### Pull requests

- Pull requests should stay in `draft` status until they are actually ready for review.
- Decide how to handle `code review` vs `functionality review`.

### Branch structure

- `main` & `develop` will be used, but _never_ directly committed to.
- All changes should be in branches based off of `develop` and include the **issue #** when there is one. Examples:
    - branches/18-repo-setup
    - branches/29-foundational-styles
    - branches/feature/53-glossary
    - branches/hotfix/99-branding-explosion
- Frontend vs Backend branches. Only when complex & necessary should we make seperate branches created for the **same feature/issue**.

### Code review and CodeClimate

- Code reviews are required to merge.
- CodeClimate is not being used.

### Environments

- All active development will happen in team member sandboxes.
- All code ready for review will be uploaded to the shared `id-presents` sandbox before review with the client.
- All code that is merged to `develop` is ready to deploy to staging at any time.
- All code that is released to staging will be done via release numbers.

## Troubleshooting

- [Force CSS and JavaScript to refresh when you deploy changes](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-child-starter/wiki/Versioning).

### Compiling errors

You'll see these types of errors in the terminal, and this should be your first stop if anything isn't working as expected, including styles not showing up. Try running the following if your theme is not compiling successfully:

1. If this theme successfully compiled before, check for a code error first. Look for red in the terminal, and see if you can trace it back to a file and line number. If the error is in your code, try to fix the error. If the error is in Responsive Foundation, continue with the following steps to see if it can be resolved. Both CSS and JavaScript errors can cause this behavior.
2. Delete `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`, even if you have already run it before.
3. Run `node -v` and `npm -v` to see your current node and npm versions. Do they match the versions in the [supported technologies list](#supported-technologies)? If not, use nvm to change the version by running `nvm use [VERSION NUMBER]`, where `[VERSION NUMBER]` is replaced with the version from the list above.

### "X isn't showing on my sandbox" errors

Once you've confirmed your theme is compiling, the next step is to make sure your files are uploading correctly.

1. If you are using monitoring or upload on save, check that the monitoring is actually enabled.
2. Check the settings in your FTP tool of choice (usually SFTP for Sublime Text, Publishing settings in Coda, or SFTP for VSCode). Is your theme mapped to the correct sandbox, and uploading to the correct folder?
3. Create a simple text file in your code editor, such as `text.txt`. Upload (don't monitor) the file using your code editor. Now, open a FTP program such as Transmit, Filezilla, or Cyberduck, and navigate to your theme folder in the server. Did the file upload? If so, your FTP is working correctly, and this is either a monitoring problem (go back to step 1) or a CSS problem (go to the next section).

### Styling errors

If you've confirmed a file is uploading, but the CSS you expect to see still isn't showing up, it's probably your CSS selector. Here's how to test that.

1. Choose a very broad text selector you can easily see, such as `body` or `h1`. Set the color to red, and use the important flag, like so: `h1 { color: red !important; }` Upload your file again.
2. If you see the change, the problem is with your selector and overriding. If you do not see the change, try one more time with a different selector.
3. If you still do not see the change, clear your cache. Try a hard refresh first (shift+cmd+r). You can also try opening a private window.
4. If you _still_ do not see the change, wait five minutes, and try again. Rarely, the issue will be with caching on the server side. Grab a coffee, come back, and give it one more try.
5. If you're still not seeing the change here, it's time to ask for help. See if a designer or developer has a few minutes to help you out in the #interactive-design channel.



# Linking to Foundation

To create a local link with Responsive Foundation use: 
- NPM Link for Node 16 or lower
- Yalc (https://github.com/wclr/yalc) for Node 16+ with NPM 7 or higher

## Yalc
Yalc acts as a local repository for your locally developed packages. 

### Linking packages

Linking a package with yalc should not make changes to your package.json file in this repo. 

You will need two terminal windows and a local copy of Responsive Foundation repo with the 6.0 or greater version as well as this repo.

#### In Responsive Foundation's terminal: 
Run `yalc publish` or better use the `npm run watch` script which will automate the process in Responsive Foundation. What you need to do in Foundation is have yalc publish each npm package you want to work on to the local repository store. So if you are making changes to burf-theme you'll want to ensure that yalc is publishing @bostonuniversity/burf-theme package and doing so every time you make a code change to it. That is where the `watch` script comes in handy as that will watch for changes and automatically publish updates to the package from your local repo files to the yalc local package repository on your machine.


#### In Responsive Child Starter's terminal:
Run `npx yalc link <package-name>`. For example `npx yalc link @bostonuniversity/burf-theme` will link up the burf-tools package to this repo so your
local changes in burf-tools within Responsive Foundation will show up here in this repo. The normal `npm start` and `npm run build` commands should
see your local changes to burf-tools and use that code. This will let you test out those code changes in this repo. 

### Unlinking packages
1. Disconnect Yalc and unlink by running `npx yalc remove <package-name>` or `npx yalc remove --all` to remove everything. Make sure to do this before merging your code changes in as Yalc should only be used for local development. Once published this repo should use versioned dependencies published to NPM or Github.
2. Run `npm install` again as your linked package may need to be reinstalled.
